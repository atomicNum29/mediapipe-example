# Mediapipe Example on Raspberry Pi 5

This project demonstrates how to run a Mediapipe model on a Raspberry Pi 5. The code is based on the examples provided in the [Mediapipe Samples repository](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples). 

However, the code has been modified to use the latest recommended camera module, **Picamera2**, instead of the default camera module.

## Features
- Mediapipe model integration on Raspberry Pi 5.
- Updated to support Picamera2 for improved camera handling.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 5 (or Raspberry Pi 4)
- Picamera2 module
- Python 3.x
- Mediapipe library

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `setup` section to install dependencies.
3. Run the example script to test the Mediapipe model with Picamera2.
